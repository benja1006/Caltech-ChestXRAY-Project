# Project156b-Red-Door-Sandwich
In CS156b, we were tasked with creating a model that could diagnose several pathologies in the CheXpert Dataset.

The project utilizes pytorch lightning to optimize training on multiple nodes in the Caltech HPC.
We chose a pretrained vision transformer by facebook called DinoVIT for the base of our model. We also explored using a GAN to create more data and a segmentation model.
